## Overview

ZenChain is the first fully decentralized blockchain to merge Bitcoin's security with Ethereum-level programmability & beyond. Designed to provide seamless and trust-minimized cross-chain interoperability with major blockchain ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more. By leveraging the Cross-Liquidity Consensus Mechanism (CLCM), Zenchain ensures secure, crypto-economically guaranteed transactions through a validator-secured framework.

Zenchain supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for smart contracts and integrates with WebAssembly (Wasm) decentralized applications, creating a seamless bridge between EVM and native Wasm runtimes for enhanced flexibility and functionality.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Powered by the Cross-Chain Interoperability Module (CCIM), Zenchain enables secure asset transfers across multiple blockchain networks with minimal trust.
- **Hybrid Mechanism**: Combining **RAGE** for rapid block production and **GUARDIAN** for finality, Zenchain ensures both speed and security.
- **ZIP-20 Token Standard**: A versatile token standard that supports asset management across external blockchains, including bridges, over-collateralization, and governance mechanisms.
- **Niō AI Security**: An AI-powered system that continuously monitors the network for potential threats, ensuring a secure and resilient environment for users and developers.
